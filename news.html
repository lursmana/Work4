          In its base Greatsword form, it has a medium attack speed with mostly
          wide, long ranged swings, whereas the strong attacks are useful
          thrusts, capable of getting opponents who like to keep their distance.
          The charge attack itself is a powerful thrust with a strong followup,
          underhead swing, knocking most opponents off their feet, much like the
          Saw Spear's charge attack in its spear state. When transformed it has
          added Arcane damage. Every strong attack will expend a Quicksilver
          Bullet while throwing an Arcane wave at an enemy. Its special
          two-handed attack is an explosive thrust, a great move as even when
          thrusting in a certain direction, the player will burst with energy
          around his body
